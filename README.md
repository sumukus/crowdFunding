# Crowdfunding
This is a crowdfunding application developed in ethereum blockchain. It uses the Rinkeby Test Network for development purpose. It is developed by following the online course [Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/) from udemy. The author has explained very nicely. It is simple and easy to understand. If you want to learn in detail I would recommend you to take this course.
